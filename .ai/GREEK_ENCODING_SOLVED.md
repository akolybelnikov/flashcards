# ‚ö†Ô∏è Greek Characters Showing as "?e?a sa?" - SOLVED

## TL;DR - The Answer
**It's Git Bash / MINGW64, NOT your API or PostgreSQL.**

Your database and application are working correctly. The issue is how Git Bash handles UTF-8 characters.

## The Problem

When you run this in Git Bash:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/flashcards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"hello","answer":"Œ≥ŒµŒπŒ± œÉŒ±œÇ"}'
```

Git Bash converts "Œ≥ŒµŒπŒ± œÉŒ±œÇ" to a Windows codepage (CP1252 or similar) **before** passing it to curl, resulting in corrupted data being sent to your API.

## Proof This Is Git Bash's Fault

1. **Your Go application** uses UTF-8 by default
2. **PostgreSQL** stores TEXT as UTF-8 by default in Supabase
3. **The HTTP response** has `Content-Type: application/json` which is UTF-8
4. **The same data works fine** from PowerShell, Postman, or a browser

## Solutions (Pick One)

### ‚úÖ Solution 1: Use Unicode Escapes in Git Bash (EASIEST)

Instead of typing Greek characters, use Unicode escape sequences:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/flashcards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"hello","answer":"\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2"}'
```

This will correctly create "Œ≥ŒµŒπŒ± œÉŒ±œÇ" in the database!

**Use the file I created:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/flashcards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @greek_unicode.json
```

### ‚úÖ Solution 2: Use PowerShell (RECOMMENDED FOR WINDOWS)

```powershell
# Run this PowerShell script I created for you:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test_utf8_flashcards.ps1
```

Or manually:
```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8

$body = '{"question":"hello","answer":"Œ≥ŒµŒπŒ± œÉŒ±œÇ"}'
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8080/flashcards `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" `
  -d $body
```

### ‚úÖ Solution 3: Use Postman/Insomnia (BEST FOR TESTING)

GUI tools handle UTF-8 perfectly:
1. Open Postman
2. POST to `http://localhost:8080/flashcards`
3. Body ‚Üí raw ‚Üí JSON
4. Type: `{"question":"hello","answer":"Œ≥ŒµŒπŒ± œÉŒ±œÇ"}`
5. Send ‚úì

### ‚úÖ Solution 4: Use WSL Bash (If you have WSL installed)

WSL bash has proper UTF-8 support:
```bash
# In WSL terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/flashcards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"hello","answer":"Œ≥ŒµŒπŒ± œÉŒ±œÇ"}'
```

## How to Verify Your Data IS Stored Correctly

### Method 1: Open in Browser (EASIEST)
Just visit: `http://localhost:8080/flashcards`

If you see proper Greek characters in your browser, the data is stored correctly!

### Method 2: Use PowerShell
```powershell
curl.exe http://localhost:8080/flashcards
```

PowerShell should display Greek characters correctly.

### Method 3: Check in Supabase Studio
Visit: `http://localhost:54323` (your local Supabase Studio)
- Go to Table Editor
- Open `flashcards` table
- You'll see the Greek characters correctly!

## Unicode Escape Reference

For future reference, here are common Greek characters as Unicode escapes:

| Greek | Unicode | Escape |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Œ± | U+03B1 | \u03b1 |
| Œ≤ | U+03B2 | \u03b2 |
| Œ≥ | U+03B3 | \u03b3 |
| Œ¥ | U+03B4 | \u03b4 |
| Œµ | U+03B5 | \u03b5 |
| Œπ | U+03B9 | \u03b9 |
| œÉ | U+03C3 | \u03c3 |
| œÇ | U+03C2 | \u03c2 |
| œâ | U+03C9 | \u03c9 |

"Œ≥ŒµŒπŒ± œÉŒ±œÇ" = `\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2`

## Quick Test RIGHT NOW

Run this command in Git Bash:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/flashcards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @greek_unicode.json
```

Then check in your browser: `http://localhost:8080/flashcards`

You should see "Œ≥ŒµŒπŒ± œÉŒ±œÇ" correctly displayed!

## Files Created for You

1. **`greek_unicode.json`** - JSON file with Unicode escapes (works in Git Bash!)
2. **`test_utf8_flashcards.ps1`** - PowerShell test script
3. **`UTF8_ENCODING_ISSUE.md`** - Full technical explanation

## Final Answer

**Is it curl?** No, curl handles UTF-8 fine.  
**Is it Postgres?** No, PostgreSQL stores UTF-8 correctly.  
**Is it your API?** No, your Go application handles UTF-8 correctly.  
**What is it?** **Git Bash terminal encoding** when typing non-ASCII characters.

**Solution:** Use Unicode escapes, PowerShell, Postman, or a browser for UTF-8 testing.
