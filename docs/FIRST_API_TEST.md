## Note About Terminal Display
The Greek characters "Œ≥ŒµŒπŒ± œÉŒ±œÇ" may appear as `?e?a sa?` in Git Bash terminal output due to terminal encoding limitations. However:
- ‚úÖ The data is stored correctly in PostgreSQL (UTF-8)
- ‚úÖ The API returns proper JSON with correct UTF-8 encoding
- ‚úÖ The HTTP response headers indicate `Content-Type: application/json` which supports UTF-8
- ‚úÖ Web browsers, Postman, and other HTTP clients will display the Greek characters correctly

## Testing in Different Environments

### Git Bash / CMD (Windows)
```bash
# May show Greek as question marks
curl http://localhost:8080/flashcards
```

### PowerShell (Better UTF-8 support)
```powershell
# Run this first to enable UTF-8
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8

curl http://localhost:8080/flashcards
```

### Save to File (Preserves encoding)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/flashcards > flashcards.json
# Open flashcards.json in a text editor that supports UTF-8
```

### Browser
Simply visit: `http://localhost:8080/flashcards` in any web browser - will display correctly!

### Postman or Insomnia
Import the request and the Greek characters will display perfectly.
